Problem Statement

Many students do not wish to compute their CGPA by hand, nor is it a speedy task, for the computation must consider a weighted average rather than a straightforward arithmetic mean. By nature, manual computation is susceptible to errors, particularly with different credit weights on different subjects. This project aims at providing an automated tool that computes CGPA instantly and accurately.
Overview The scope of the project is divided into two parts:
The scope of this project is to develop a lightweight, console-based application in Python that:
• Accepts user input for grades of courses and their respective credit values.
* Takes the mathematical weighted average.

* Displays a summary of the inputs and the final calculated result.
* Can be used multiple times in a single session via an interactive loop.

Target Users
* **University/College Students:** Monitor their academic performance in order to determine their current standing.
* **Academic Advisors:** To quickly assist students in estimating their grades during counseling sessions.
Features - Overview * Dynamic Input Handling: This system provides a way for the user to define exactly how many subjects they want to enter for the current calculation. * Weighted CGPA Algorithm: It implements the precise logic of multiplying certain grades by their credit weight and then dividing by the total credits. * **Data Verification:** Displays lists of inputted grades and credits back to the user to confirm the correctness of the data entered. * **Continuous Operation:** Provides a "Do you wish to calculate any more" feature so that users may continuously conduct the calculations in a single run of the application.
